## Problem 1 – 
1. Take two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input.  
2. Take the type of operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) as input.  
3. Use a class with a method that checks the operation type.  
4. Perform the calculation:
   - Addition → `a + b`
   - Subtraction → `a - b`
   - Multiplication → `a * b`
   - Division → `a / b` (check if `b` is not zero)
5. Display the result.

## Problem 2 – 
1. Take an integer `a` as input.  
2. Start from 1 and keep adding 2 to get the next odd number.  
3. Repeat this process `a` times.  
4. Store each odd number in a list and display it.  
   - Formula for nth odd number: `2 * n - 1`

## Problem 3 – 
1. Take an integer `a` as input.  
2. If `a` is even, reduce it by 1 (`a = a - 1`).  
3. Generate odd numbers using the same logic as Problem 2.  
4. Display the resulting list.

## Problem 4 – 
1. Take a list of numbers from the user.  
2. Create a dictionary with keys from 1 to 9, all starting at 0.  
3. For each key `i` (1 to 9), check each number in the list.  
4. If a number is divisible by `i` (remainder 0), increase that key’s count.  
5. Display the dictionary showing how many numbers are divisible by each key.
